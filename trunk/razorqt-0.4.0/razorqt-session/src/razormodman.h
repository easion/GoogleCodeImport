RazorModuleManager handles the session management (logout/restart/shutdown)
as well.

Processes in RazorModuleManager are split into 2 sets.
 - basic processes, window manager, Razor components. Which has to be started
   first.
 - autostart processes, user defined 3rd party apps, which hast to be started
   *after* razor parts are running (eg. due panel's systray). Autostart is delayed
   in the RazorModuleManager constructor.

Potential process recovering is done in \see restartModules()
